# Youtube Practice.

This is one the my favorites project I did with Python. I use the library **YOUTUBE_DL** basicle download videos from YouTube.com and  **PYDUB**.  manipulate audio with an simple and easy high level interface.  I downloud in total 3 sounds but I made so funny things like manipulation the songs. We conect wiht twitter API and googlesheet to put the sound information. 

In this project I used basic and intermidia knowled with Python like:

- logging
- typing
- config file
- connect with googlesheet
- create csv files
- tweepy
- sqlite3
- gspread
