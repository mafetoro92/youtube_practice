# Youtube Practice.

This is one the my favorite projects I did with Python. I used the library YOUTUBE_DL to download videos from YouTube.com and  PYDUB to manipulate audio with a simple and easy high level interface. I downloaded 3 songs and did some funny manipulation to them. I then connected to the Twitter API and googlesheet to put the sound information on Twitter and Google Sheet.

In this project I used basic and intermediate knowledge with Python like:

- logging
- typing
- config file
- connect with googlesheet
- create csv files
- tweepy
- sqlite3
- gspread
